# MLProj1
Machine Learning Project 1

GITHUB LINK: https://github.com/jduan39/MLProj1


Requirements: Pandas, sci-kit learn, numpy, python 3.6, scipy


DATASETS: inpatientCharges.csv, train.csv

CSV files written to with scores: titanicAB.csv (adaboost), titanicDT.csv (decision tree), titanicknn.csv (KNN), titanicnn.csv (neural net)

Files to run: titanic.py, second.py

How to run: 
- on Windows: python "filename".py - with no quotations
- on Mac: python3 "filename".py - with no quotations


Specific Algorithms: 

Each algorithm has been commented out, so just uncomment whichever algorithm you want to run and then run it. 
For each algorithm it writes to a csv with the cross validation scores, training scores, and testing scores. 
Both datasets write to the same CSV for each algorithm so make sure you have the data for one dataset before running the other because it will overwrite it in the csv. 
The SVM statistics will be printed to the console.
