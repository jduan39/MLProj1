# MLProj1
Machine Learning Project 1


Requirements: Pandas, sci-kit learn, numpy, python 3.6, scipy


DATASETS: inpatientCharges.csv, train.csv

Files to run: titanic.py, second.py

How to run: 
- on Windows: python "filename".py - with no quotations
- on Mac: python3 "filename".py - with no quotations


Specific Algorithms: 

Each algorithm has been commented out, so just uncomment whichever algorithm you want to run and then run it. 
For each algorithm it writes to a csv with the cross validation scores, training scores, and testing scores. Both datasets use the same 4 csv files to write to, so make sure you have the data for one dataset before running the other because it will overwrite it in the csv. The SVM statistics will be printed to the console.
